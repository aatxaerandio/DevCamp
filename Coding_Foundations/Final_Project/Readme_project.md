# Final Project
This is the final project of the course Coding Foundations, where a replica of the CodePen.io homepage was made. In this repository, apart from the screen shot of the webpage to replicate, the files for the webpage are divided in three folders:

## Project_html
This folder contains the index.html for the project.

## Project_images
This folder contains the images used in the project.

## Project_css
This folder contains all the css style documents for the project, listed bellow:

### common.css
Common style for all the html elements.
### nav.css
This document contains the styles for the navigation wrapper located in the header of the webpage. It is separated in two sections, one composed by the logo and navigations links (right-wrapper), whereas the other is composed by Create, Find, Log In and Sign Up (Left-wrapper).
### page-content.css
This document contains styles for the page content and is divided in 3 sections. The first is composed by the styles for the page content, with the left and right wrappers. The second section is composed by the styles for CodePen wrapper. Finally, styles for the end-page.
### buttons.css
This document contains styles for the buttons of the webpage. They are separated in two sections, the styles corresponding to the buttons located in the navigation bar and the ones located in the page container. 
### media-queries.css
This purpose of this document is to make the webpage adequate to view in different screen sizes, such as in mobile devices. In this case, when the size is smaller than 1080px, the page will take another design and page contents will be viewed properly.
