#Final Project
This is the final project of the course Coding Foundations, where a replica of the CodePen.io homepage was made. In this repository, apart from the screen shot of the webpage to replicate, the files for the webpage are divided in three folders:


##Project_html
This folder contains the images used in the project.

##Project_html
This folder contains the index.html for the project.

##Project_css
This folder contains all the css style documents for the project.

###common.css
Common style for all the html elements.
####nav.css
This document contains the styles for the navigation wrapper located in the header of the webpage. It is separated in two sections, one composed by the logo and navigations links (right-wrapper), whereas the other is composed by Create, Find, Log In and Sign Up (Left-wrapper).
