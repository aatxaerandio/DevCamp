# FUNCIONES

""" WHAT ARE THEY FOR
- we have an input
- the function does what it needs to do
- we get an output

This process can be called later from any part of the program, 
which prevents us from having code repeated several times

SYNTAX for function that receives arguments (inputs) and returns 
data (outputs):

def function_name(inputs):
 return output

receiving and returning data is optional, but it is most common
