# 1. Introduction to GIT

# 2. GIT vs GitHub
Basically, GitHub is a Hub for Git projects.
GitHub is a repository to create, modify and share code.

# 3. Repositories
Simply wrappers and hosting providers for GIT. 
### Github
general purpose providers out there. It works very well in team situations it has a good issue tracker and it's very easy to be able to have one spot I can go to with all of my centralized repositories, from a pricing perspective, it's not bad either.
### GitLab
If you work on an Enterprise, or if you have a number of requirements such as working with LDAP which is how you can connect a Windows Active Directory set of authentication protocols directly into your code repositories. 
### BickBucket
This means it also works pretty well for an enterprise environment. Price is more affordable. Unlimited private repos inside of their free tier.

# 4. Configure Git
Follow the instructions to install and configure, git name, email, etc.
Connect Git to GitHub:
-	HTTPS encrypted protocol, 
-	SSH secure shell, 
Nothing one better than the other.
