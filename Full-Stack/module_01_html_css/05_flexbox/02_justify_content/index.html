But what it allows you to do is to call an url and then it is going to give you a random image from their library. So I can say https://source.unsplash.com and then slash random and then you can pass in a size so here I'm going to say 150X150. And now if I hit save you can see we have an image right there. 

height = make calculation, so use calc() and put 100% of the viewHeight/widt minux 20px.

By deafult, ist is put as a row based direction. So jutify content does not do anything there.

---

justify-content

Justify the content of the sinlge DIV that encompasses the images inside.
Default is flex-start --> Wuill put things in the start. 
flex-end --> all the way to the right hand size or down, depending on the DIV direction.
flex-center --> As has only one item(one div)it will not make anything. 
space-between --> look for the all avbailbnle space in the container and then put space between the elemetns inside de DIV.
space-around --> look for all the avbailble space, but more "centered" and well distributed.

If you use row instead of coluimns, images will be blurred completely as we are using two flex containers. 
The wasy to fix this is to change the flex direction.
