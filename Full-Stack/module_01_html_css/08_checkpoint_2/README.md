#### Task Three - Create a user story referencing one website
I choose Google website as reference. A simple user story is:
**As** Google user, **I need** a new feature in the interface of google search that provide users with a shorcut to make a google search by images, **So that** I can browse figures in a much more efficient and rapid way.

#### Task Four - Identify the prime objective of Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Youtube.
1. The primordial objective of **Twitter**, or X, is to network people by allowing the broadcast short posts to share news, thoughts, comments, opinions, and promote feedback and interactions.
2. Similarly to Twitter, **Facebook** looks for the same purpose but allowing larger posts, longer videos and advertisement, encouraging interactions among users.
3. In the case of **Google**, its prime objective is to provide users with a bunch of tools to use in their daily basis (browser, maps, email, etc).
4. Lastly, **Youtube´s** prime objective is to create and share content of any kind to be visualized by the global audience.
